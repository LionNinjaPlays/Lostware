# Lostware
A Bug Fixing and Code Adding Tool for Malware.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Status
Lostware is currently under development, will be pushed to GitHub soon, along with Alpha & Beta releases before the full release, as well as Alpha (maybe) and Beta/Test Build releases after the first release.

# Version
Lostware is currently on Version 0.0.1-INDEV-ALPHA, meaning Version 0.0.1-In Development-Alpha. For Alpha and Beta releases, Lostware will release, incompleted, with new features and/or bug fixes being added each release, when it comes time for the full release, Lostware will have all its features (however new features probably will be released with newer releases), and will have been tested for bugs which will be fixed, if possible of course. After the full release, there will be Alpha (maybe) and Beta/Test Builds before the release of that version. Keep in mind, these test builds may have bugs and things may be added or removed before the full release of the version, and there will most likely be more than one test build for each version.
